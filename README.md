#GlobalConflictMitigator
Overview
GlobalConflictMitigator is a comprehensive tool designed to analyze conflict data and generate actionable mitigation strategies. The application leverages machine learning models and a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide insights and strategies for resolving conflicts across different regions of the world.

This project was developed as part of my final year project, focusing on the intersection of data science, machine learning, and AI-driven decision-making in the context of global conflict resolution.

Features
Data Analysis: Perform in-depth analysis of conflict data, including event types, fatalities, and regional patterns.
Predictive Modeling: Use a Random Forest model to classify regions based on conflict data.
LLM-Powered Strategy Generation: Generate detailed and tailored conflict mitigation strategies using an LLM based on the model's predictions.
User-Friendly Interface: Interact with the data and models through a streamlined Streamlit application.
Customizable Models: Adjust model parameters to refine predictions and strategies.

Analyze Data
Once the data is uploaded, the app will perform preprocessing and display key insights about the data, including:

Distribution of conflict events by region.
Analysis of fatalities and event types.

# Model Training and Evaluation
You can train the Random Forest model directly within the app, adjusting hyperparameters as needed. The app will display:

Classification report of the model's performance.
Feature importance to understand key drivers of conflict in different regions.
Generate Mitigation Strategies
Using the trained model's predictions, generate conflict mitigation strategies tailored to specific regions. The strategies are generated using an LLM and cover immediate, medium-term, and long-term measures.
